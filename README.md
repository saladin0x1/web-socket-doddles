# Web Socket Doddles

**Web Socket Doddles** is a fun little school project made to test real-time WebSocket communication between users and an admin. It’s a quiz app where users can buzz in to answer questions, and the admin can control the session and dispatch questions. Built with basic HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and WebSockets, it's more of a doodle than a fully-fledged app!

## How It Works

- **Users**: Connect to the session, receive questions, and buzz in with their answers.
- **Admin**: Starts the session, controls the number of users, and sends questions to everyone.
- **Sessions**: Users can join a session as long as there’s space, and admins can set the user limit.
- **Real-time**: All interactions happen in real-time, with WebSockets ensuring immediate responses.

**This project is just for fun and testing.** Don’t expect production-ready features—this is just a playful doodle to test WebSockets in action.

## Future Plan

This project will eventually be refactored and switched to **React** for a more scalable and modern approach to handling the UI and state management. Stay tuned for a better version that includes a more structured React architecture! ⚛️

Enjoy and feel free to mess around with it! 🎉
